# Villanova_Basketball

This report will cover a variety of questions surrounding Villanova basketball that I have asked and answered with statistical inference, plots, and probability models. I have segmented the article into 2 main sections, corresponding to the season in which I am performing these analyses. I begin with a short analysis of the Villanova vs Georgetown game from the current season (2020-2021), because I think it is the most exciting game thus far. After that, I investigate clutch shooting for Villanova’s players in both the 2020-2021 and 2019-2020 seasons and then model the starters’ shooting streaks from 2019-2020 to see if any of them have a hot hand or not. The analysis for these questions exists in the html file.

I also explored Villanova's teamwide statistics. Specifically, I plotted the shot types chosen and their percentages for different score differentials to determine how the decision making or gameplan changes as the team takes a lead or falls behind. Additionally, I looked into play lengths for Big East Teams and their players to determine teamwide trends in clock management and who is likely to take a shot late in the shot clock for major Big East programs. These analyses are found along with the above analyses in the presentation.
